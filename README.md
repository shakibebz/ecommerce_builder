This Laravel application serves as an intermediary API service, acting as a robust bridge between a data-gathering service (e.g., a Python web crawler) and a Magento 2 e-commerce platform.

The core purpose of this service is to create a controlled, manual approval workflow. Instead of sending data directly to Magento, products are first staged in a local database. An operator can then review, edit, and approve these products before manually triggering a synchronization to create or update them in Magento.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Product Staging:** Receives product data from a crawler and stores it locally.
*   **Manual Approval Workflow:** Products are held in a `pending_review` state until an operator takes action.
*   **Operator CRUD Interface:** Provides RESTful endpoints for an operator's front-end application to List, View, and Update the staged products.
*   **Controlled Magento Sync:** A dedicated endpoint allows an operator to manually push an approved product to Magento.
*   **Dual-Layer Security:**
    *   **API Key Authentication** for trusted machine-to-machine communication (the crawler).
    *   **Laravel Sanctum** for authenticating user-facing applications (the operator's dashboard).
*   **Error Handling & Logging:** If a sync to Magento fails, the product status is updated to `error` with a descriptive message, allowing for easy diagnosis and retries.

## üöÄ Architecture Flow

The data flow is designed for control and observability.

```
+----------------+      +---------------------------+      +----------------+
| Python Crawler | --1->|    Laravel Bridge API     | --2->|    Database    |
+----------------+      | (POST /crawler/products)  |      |  (MySQL/PgSQL) |
                        +-------------^-------------+      +-------^--------+
                                      |                            | 4. Update
                                      | 3. CRUD & Sync             |    Product
                                      v                            |    Status
                        +-------------+-------------+      +-------+--------+
                        |      Operator's App       | --5->|   Magento 2    |
                        |     (SPA / Frontend)      |      | (via REST API) |
                        +---------------------------+      +----------------+
```
1.  The **Crawler** sends new product data to a secure endpoint.
2.  The **Laravel API** validates the data and stores it in the local **Database** with a `pending_review` status.
3.  The **Operator's App** fetches pending products, allowing an operator to review and edit them.
4.  After editing, the operator can trigger a **Sync**, which calls a dedicated endpoint on the Laravel API.
5.  The **Laravel API** then makes a request to the **Magento 2 API** to create or update the product. The local product's status is updated to `synced` or `error`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local development machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
*   PHP >= 8.2
*   Composer
*   Node.js & npm
*   A database server (e.g., MySQL)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/behzadiziy/magento.git
cd magento
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
composer install
npm install
npm run build
```

### 4. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file by copying the example file.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Now, open `.env` and configure the following variables:

```dotenv

# API Key for the Python Web Crawler
CRAWLER_API_KEY=YourSecureRandomCrawlerKey

# Magento 2 Instance Details
MAGENTO_BASE_URL=https://your-magento-instance.com
MAGENTO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_magento_access_token

# Sanctum configuration (for the operator's SPA front-end)
SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=localhost:3000
```

### 5. Final Setup Commands
```bash
# Generate a new application key
php artisan key:generate

# Run the database migrations
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Start the Server
```bash
php artisan serve
```
Your API will now be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## üîê API Endpoints Documentation

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

### Crawler Endpoint

Authentication is handled via an API Key passed in the `X-API-KEY` header.

#### `POST /crawler/products`
Submits a new product from the crawler for staging.

*   **Headers:**
    *   `Accept: application/json`
    *   `X-API-KEY: {{crawler_api_key}}`
*   **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
        "sku": "CRAWLER-SKU-001",
        "name": "Product from Crawler",
        "description": "A detailed product description.",
        "price": 199.99,
        "stock_quantity": 50
    }
    ```
*   **Success Response (201 Created):**
    ```json
    {
        "id": 1,
        "sku": "CRAWLER-SKU-001",
        "name": "Product from Crawler",
        // ... other fields
        "status": "pending_review",
        "created_at": "...",
        "updated_at": "..."
    }
    ```

---
